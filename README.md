# Universal Relay TodoMVC

This is a clone of [found-relay's example](https://github.com/4Catalyzer/found-relay/blob/master/examples/todomvc-modern-universal) but using [`react-relay-network-modern`](https://github.com/nodkz/react-relay-network-modern) plus [SSR middleware](https://github.com/nodkz/react-relay-network-modern-ssr).

## Usage

```shell
yarn install
yarn start
```

Then point your browser at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

## Notes

- Most of the code is taken directly from [the official example](https://github.com/relayjs/relay-examples/tree/master/todo) and falls under [the license there](https://github.com/relayjs/relay-examples/tree/master/todo#license).
- The `yarn install` command runs webpack-dev-server, and accepts other options, e.g. `yarn start --port 5000`.
